\chapter{Compliance Programs}\label{ch:compliance}

\begin{abstract}
Effective compliance is continuous, data‑driven and woven into trading
workflows.  We detail trade surveillance, best‑execution testing, and
regulatory reporting obligations.
\end{abstract}

\section{Trade Surveillance}

\begin{description}
  \item[Market‑Manipulation Patterns] Spoofing, layering, quote stuffing.
  \item[Insider Dealing] Unusual volume ahead of material events.
\end{description}

\subsection*{SQL Pattern Example}

\begin{minted}{sql}
SELECT trader_id, COUNT(*) AS cancels
FROM orders
WHERE action='CANCEL'
  AND timestamp BETWEEN :t0 AND :t1
GROUP BY trader_id
HAVING cancels > 10 * executed;
\end{minted}

\section{Best‑Execution Testing}

Compare realised execution price to volume‑weighted NBBO benchmark;
RTS‑28 disclosure in EU.

\section{Regulatory Reporting}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{EMIR / CFTC Part 45} – swap data repositories.
  \item \textbf{MiFIR Transaction Reporting} – 65 fields incl. algo
        identifier.
  \item \textbf{CAT} (U.S.) – order lifecycle from origination to execution.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Key Takeaways}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Automation and audit‑trails are mandatory; manual processes fail
        at scale.
  \item Surveillance models require continuous calibration to new tactics.
\end{itemize}
