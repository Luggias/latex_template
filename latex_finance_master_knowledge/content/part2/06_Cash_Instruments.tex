\chapter{Cash Instruments}\label{ch:cash}

\begin{abstract}
“Cash” or spot instruments settle rapidly (T\(+\)0–T\(+\)2) and convey
unlevered exposure to the underlying asset.  
Despite their simplicity, understanding cash instruments is a prerequisite for
pricing derivatives that reference them.
\end{abstract}

\section{Equities}

Purchasing common stock grants an economic claim on residual cash flows
and (often) voting rights.  Settlement convention: \emph{T\(+\)2} in most
developed markets.  Key lifecycle events:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Dividend Date Trio}: \emph{declaration}, \emph{ex‑div}, \emph{payment}.
  \item \textbf{Corporate Actions}: splits, mergers, spin‑offs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Total‑Return Decomposition}

Let \(P_t\) be price and \(D_t\) cumulative dividends until \(t\).  
Total return over \(\Delta t\):

\[
R_{t,t+\Delta t} = \frac{P_{t+\Delta t}-P_t + (D_{t+\Delta t}-D_t)}{P_t}.
\]

\section{Fixed‑Income Securities}

\subsection{Coupon‑Bearing Bonds}

Price is present value of future coupons \(C_i\) and face value \(F\):

\[
P_0 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{C_i}{(1+y)^{t_i}} + \frac{F}{(1+y)^{T}} .
\]

Display DV01 in Python:

\begin{minted}{python}
import numpy as np
def dv01(y, cashflows, times):
    # cashflows and times in years
    pv = np.exp(-y*np.array(times))
    return 1e-4 * np.sum(np.array(times) * cashflows * pv)
\end{minted}

\section{Money‑Market Instruments}

Treasury bills, commercial paper, certificates of deposit.  
Quoting conventions vary (discount rate vs money‑market yield).

\section{Repos}

Repurchase agreements combine a spot bond sale and a forward repurchase.
Repo rate \(\rho\) implies:

\[
1 + \rho \Delta t = \frac{P_{\text{sell}}}{P_{\text{buy}}}.
\]

\section*{Key Takeaways}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cash instruments provide the benchmark curves from which forward
        and derivative prices are bootstrapped.
  \item Conventions (day‑count, settlement) materially affect quoted yields.
\end{enumerate}
