\chapter{Introduction to Derivatives}\label{ch:derivintro}

\begin{abstract}
Derivatives transform the payoff profile of cash instruments, enabling
leverage, hedging, and access to otherwise illiquid exposures.
We introduce forwards, futures and swaps—the building blocks for options.
\end{abstract}

\section{Forwards}

A forward contract fixes a purchase price \(K\) today for delivery at \(T\).
No cash changes hands at inception.

\subsection{Forward Pricing via Cost‑of‑Carry}

\[
F_{0,T} = S_0 e^{(r + u - q)T},
\]
with storage cost \(u\) and continuous dividend yield \(q\).

\section{Futures}

Exchange‑traded, daily‑settled analogues of forwards.

\begin{definition}{Mark‑to‑Market}{}
Gains/losses are credited to the margin account at each daily settlement
price, eliminating counterparty credit exposure.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Convexity Adjustment}

For interest‑rate futures the forward–futures difference is
second‑order in rate volatility:
\[
F^{\text{fut}}_{0,T} - F^{\text{fwd}}_{0,T}
      \approx \tfrac12 \sigma_r^2 T \bar P(T)^2 .
\]

\section{Swaps}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Interest‑Rate Swap}: fixed vs floating coupons.
  \item \textbf{Total‑Return Swap}: exchange of total return on an asset for funding plus spread.
\end{itemize}

Fixed‑rate leg is set so that PV(fixed) = PV(floating) \(\Rightarrow\) par swap rate.

\section*{Key Takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Forwards lock in price, futures add daily cash‑flow path dependency.
  \item Swaps are sequences of forwards; net present value at initiation is ~0.
\end{itemize}
