\chapter{Order Routing \& Market Connectivity}\label{ch:orderrouting}

\begin{abstract}
Fast and reliable connectivity determines execution quality.  We dissect
network architectures, connectivity protocols (FIX, ITCH/OUCH) and smart
order‑routing (SOR) algorithms that optimise venue selection.
\end{abstract}

\section{Connectivity Topology}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Direct Market Access (DMA)} – broker pipes orders straight
        to exchange gateways.
  \item \textbf{Sponsored Access} – client bypasses broker systems but
        uses broker’s membership (must pass “15c3‑5” filters).
  \item \textbf{Colocation} – servers hosted in exchange data centre;
        round‑trip latencies \(<\SI{100}{\micro\second}\).
\end{itemize}

\section{Protocols}

\paragraph{FIX 4.x} Human‑readable tag = value pairs; survives middle‑/back‑office because of extensibility.  
\paragraph{ITCH/OUCH} Binary, sequence‑numbered; carries full L2 feed and nanosecond timestamps.

\section{Smart Order Routing (SOR)}

Algorithm partitions a parent order across venues \(i\) with probability
proportional to depth and historical fill rates:
\[
w_i = \frac{D_i^{\alpha}}{\sum_j D_j^{\alpha}},
\]
where \(\alpha\in[0,1]\) tunes aggressiveness vs liquidity.

\section{Risk Controls}

* Pre‑trade checks: notional, share and price collars.  
* Kill‑switches triggered by runaway fills or connectivity loss.

\section*{Key Takeaways}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Latency matters but deterministic jitter and fail‑over matter more.
  \item FIX is lingua franca; binary feeds power sub‑millisecond decisioning.
\end{enumerate}
